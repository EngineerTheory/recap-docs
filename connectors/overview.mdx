## What are Connectors
Connectors hook up RECAP to your data sources so that answers are grounded in your organization's knowledge.

### Connectors help you
- **Choose Sources** so you can include only the data you want indexed.
- **Configure Access** so RECAP can securely access data with your permission.
- **Set Up Fetching** options to keep RECAP's answers up to date.


## Monitoring Connectors
