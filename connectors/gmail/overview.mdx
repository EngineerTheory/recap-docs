## How it works
The Gmail connector ingests your mails. It syncs the latest information from 
your Gmail every 10 minutes.
    - Currently supports plain text emails.

## Setting up
Note: This Connector is relatively involved to set up.

- If you want to setup the connector via individual account OAuth, follow the guide [here](/connectors/gmail/oauth).
This does not require a business Google Workspace.
