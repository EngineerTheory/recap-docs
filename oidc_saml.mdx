As part of the Enterprise Edition, Recap adds support for OIDC / SAML and integrates with popular
IdPs (e.g. Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, etc). We also have and will continue to add new integrations with custom, in-house IdPs on request.

If this is something you are looking for, please [reach to us directly](https://docs.Recap.dev/contact_us) and we'd be happy to work with
you to set this up.
