## RECAP Overview

RECAP is the AI Assistant connected to your organization’s docs, apps, and people. RECAP makes Generative AI more versatile for work by enabling
new types of questions like “What is the most common feature request we’ve heard from customers this month”. Whereas other AI systems have no
context of your team and are generally unhelpful with work related questions, RECAP makes it possible to ask these questions in natural language
and get back answers in seconds.

RECAP can connect to +30 different tools and the use cases are not limited to the ones in the following pages. The highlighted use cases are
for inspiration and come from feedback gathered from our users and customers.

## Common Getting Started Questions:
#### Why are these docs connected in my RECAP deployment?
> **Answer:** This is just an example of how connectors work in RECAP. You can connect up your own team’s knowledge and you will be able to ask
questions unique to your organization. RECAP will keep all of the knowledge up to date and in sync with your connected applications.

#### Is my data being sent anywhere when I connect it up to RECAP?
> **Answer:** No! RECAP is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on
with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within RECAP. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate
answers.

#### Where is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?
> **Answer:** This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of RECAP features built on top of the MIT/community edition. If you are on RECAP Cloud,
you have access to them by default. If you’re running it yourself, reach out to the RECAP team to receive access.
