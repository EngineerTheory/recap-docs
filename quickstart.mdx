## Requirements

    - git
    - Docker with compose (docker version >= 1.13.0)
    - System requirements found [here](https://docs.RECAP.work/resourcing)

## Setup


<Warning>
  The most common source of issues is under-resourcing. Before beginning, check
  the system requirements [here](https://docs.RECAP.work/resourcing).
</Warning>

    1. Clone the RECAP repo we provide

    2. Navigate to **RECAP/deployment/docker_compose**
    ```bash
    cd RECAP/deployment/docker_compose
    ```

    3. (Optional) [configure RECAP](/configuration_guide)

    4. Bring up your docker engine and run:
        - To pull images from DockerHub and run RECAP:
        ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p RECAP-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate
        ```
        - Alternatively, to build the containers from source and start RECAP, run:
         ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p RECAP-stack up -d --build --force-recreate
        ```
        - This may take 15+ minutes depending on your internet speed.
            - Additionally, once the images have been pulled / built, the initial startup of the `api_server` 
            may take some time (we download embedding models from HuggingFace to power the search). If you see 
            `This site canâ€™t be reached` in your browser despite all containers being up and running, 
            check the `api_server` logs and make sure you see `Application startup complete`. 
            - If you see `Killed` in the logs, you may need to increase the amount of memory given to Docker. 
            For recommendations, check the system requirements [here](https://docs.RECAP.work/resourcing).

<Info>
  These commands are also used to redeploy if any **.env** variables are updated

    5. RECAP will now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Generative AI API Key

**Note:** On the initial visit, RECAP will prompt for an OpenAI API key.

You can get an OpenAI API key at:
[https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

<Info>
  You can also replace OpenAI with a model provider of your choice, see
  [here](https://docs.RECAP.work/gen_ai_configs/overview) for more info
</Info>


## Indexing Documents

**This quickstart guide will index a publicly accessible website as this requires no additional authorization setup** 

    1. Navigate to the top right of RECAP's home screen and select **Admin Panel**

    2. In the Web Connector dashboard, pick any base URL to index.
        - This will index all pages under that base URL that is reachable from hyperlinks.
        - You can check the indexing status page to monitor the progress.

    3. After the pages are indexed, you can now navigate back to the homepage and start asking questions and getting
    answers! ðŸ¥³

## Shutting Down

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p RECAP-stack down
```

<Info>
  add `-v` at the end to additionally delete the volumes (containing users and indexed
  documents){" "}
